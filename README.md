# visualwholebodygenesis
A port of Visual Whole-Body for Loco-Manipulation from Ericonaldo from isaac gym to genesis


Okay so this is for the benefit of anyone reading the original repos

So basically 99% of this is just configs that for some reason are made
using classes instead of dicts AND THEN turns them to dicts?

It unnesarily verbose but, it should be noted, very to de-depencize
I dont disagree with the result but i question why it was done in such a verbose manner

I will give it props, it is efficient, using torch and jit does speed up
stuff. I will be removing alot but I would like to thank the original
contributors.
